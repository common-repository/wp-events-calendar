In general?

We don't know either.

With regards to this plugin?

Patrick Garman, the original author that created this plugin had great ideas for it but was unable to realize those ideas. Maybe because he was busy with his other 20+ plugins full of awesomeness. So this plugin hadn't been updated in over 5 years. Anyways, we specialize in events and calendars and stuff like that, so we offered to take this puppy over and Patrick agreed to let us have it. He actually shook his fist at us and screamed "I'm gonna let you have it!". Great guy. Be sure to check his other work at https://profiles.wordpress.org/patrickgarman#content-plugins. So we've taken over and are going to start getting something happening here real soon.
